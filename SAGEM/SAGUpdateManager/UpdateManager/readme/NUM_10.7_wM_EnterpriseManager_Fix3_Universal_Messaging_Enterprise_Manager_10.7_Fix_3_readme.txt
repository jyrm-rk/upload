NUM-16219 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

Top tab has been updated to display more channel details

NUM-15236 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

The Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fails to perform some operations
because it uses non-admin connections to the Universal Messaging server for those operations.
When the Universal Messaging server is configured to not allow non-admin client connections,
the Enterprise Manager fails to perform the operations that use non-admin connections to the server.
For example, the problem happens after you set the ClusterMode parameter to 'Replication', which
means Universal Messaging does not allow non-admin connections to cluster nodes other than the 
master node.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-13424 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

Enterprise Manager does not connect to nsps port.
This issue has been resolved.

NUM-15315 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

The Enterprise Manager for Universal Messaging might stop responding when you click a queue to view 
its status.
Such a situation might also happen when you try to view the status of a channel or a durable in the 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-15163 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Universal Messaging writes messages to already rolled nirvana.log files.
The problem occurs because Universal Messaging does not use the correct logging framework. The 
server uses the default logging framework instead of the additionally specified Log4J2 framework.
The issue is resolved. Now all packages use the correct logger for the package level.

NUM-14901 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Exporting or importing a realm configuration into XML results in missing or incomplete joins 
details.
When exporting or importing realm configurations from Enterprise Manager or using the "nexportrealm" 
or "nimportrealm" code samples, one of the following issues occurs:
- The exported XML file does not include any information about the remote joins.
- The joins entries in the exported XML file do not include the details of the remote realm, which 
incorrectly represents the join as local.
- The information about the remote joins does not get imported.
The issues are now resolved.

NUM-13647 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Importing the interfaces are based on ports uniqueness based. nsp and nsps imports work when the 
aliases are similar. It creates new aliases with new ports and work. But due to some reason, the 
nhp and nhps didn't work when the aliases are similar. But they work when the aliases are 
different. 
When an interface with the same host and port is present, a new interface gets added and then the 
status is changes to Error. 
These issues are solved.


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new 
messages and these messages will appear in English.
