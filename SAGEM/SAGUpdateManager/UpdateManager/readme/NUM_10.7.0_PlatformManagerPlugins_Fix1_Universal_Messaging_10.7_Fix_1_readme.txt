NUM-15026

Command Central configuration UI for Universal Messaging hangs when the UM Server 
is configured to use the cluster mode as 'Replication'. This happens for the 
JNDI configuration screens and when the instance connected to by the Command Central 
is a slave node.

The issue is resolved.

NUM-14980

Newly added servers to an existing Universal Messaging cluster cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.

In Command Central, when you add more than one realm server to an existing
Universal Messaging cluster at the same time, the newly added servers cannot
establish inter-realm communication between each other.

The issue is resolved.
