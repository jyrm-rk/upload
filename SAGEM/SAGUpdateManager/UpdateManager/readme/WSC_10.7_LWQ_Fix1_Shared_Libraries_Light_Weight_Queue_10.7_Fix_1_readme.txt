PIF-15056
My webMethods Server reports the following error under a high workload:
[TE Task Timed Event Handler ] - Cannot handle BLOB. ERROR XJ076: The position argument '389'
exceeds the size of the BLOB/CLOB.
at org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.Util.newIOException
at org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.LOBInputStream.read
...
at com.webmethods.lwq.ext.FifoQueue.peek
at com.webmethods.lwq.impl.QueueMode.peek

This issue occurs because event peek operation is not thread-safe. This not only causes peek to fail
as reported in the above error, but also cause issues in insert/remove operations.

This issue is resolved.
