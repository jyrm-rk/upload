8.0 Installation

Install using Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at
http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(AIX only) Please stop all software mentioned in "3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected" and then
execute "/usr/sbin/slibclean" as root before attempting to install this Fix.

(AIX only) If not done already, either install all Software AG products below "/opt/softwareag" or
create a symbolic link at "/opt/softwareag" pointing to the actual installation directory.

(AIX only) Some products might still setup the environment variables LIBPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
append the system's standard paths "/usr/lib" and/or "/lib". They usually do this via a script
ending on "env" and residing in the product's INSTALL/-directory, e.g.
/opt/softwareag/EntireX/INSTALL/exxenv_, /opt/softwareag/AdabasClient/INSTALL/aclenv_, etc. These
lines must be edited and the system's standard paths must be removed.
Example before editing:
  LIBPATH=${acllibpath}:/lib:/usr/lib
Example after editing:
  LIBPATH=${acllibpath}
Please note, these changes are only necessary on AIX and should not be made on other platforms!



9.0 Uninstallation

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to
uninstall the previously installed fix.

Uninstall using Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at
http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(AIX only) Please stop all software mentioned in "3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected" and then
execute "/usr/sbin/slibclean" as root before attempting to remove this Fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods product suite and
includes support for operation in any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing

This fix may have some globalization impact.


10.1 Localization

messages will appear in English.
